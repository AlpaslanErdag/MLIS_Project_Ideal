# MLIS_Project_Ideal 


So we first cleaned the data, we implemented the code with SGD classifier 


The official code is in the file names Main Code so please check that and use it.
That is the official jupyter notebook that we will submit to the examiners


## TODO 

First add more conclusions to the code the insights and stuff to it, then we need to implement the code with SVM kernel 
Report still left


## Milestones  
* Cleaned data 
* Implemented SGD 
* Created a code template
* Create confussin matrix code
